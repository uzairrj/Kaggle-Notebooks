## 1. ðŸ§  Mental Disorder | EDA | NB & RF (100%)
This notebook delves into patient's symptoms to identify mental disorders, which are health issues affecting emotions, thoughts, or behaviors and can lead to distress in various life areas. Initially, we clean and prepare the data for visualization. Then, we perform exploratory data analysis to understand how different symptoms relate to each other. Lastly, we leverage the decision-making capability of the Random Forest and the probabilistic advantage of the Naive Bayes, blending them through a soft voting classifier to accurately diagnose patients using their symptoms.
